# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-29)

**Core value:** Users can diagnose their plants' problems through photos and AI, and the app proactively tracks recovery — so no plant issue goes forgotten.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Precision Care — Phase 4: Schema Foundation, Waves 0+1 complete and Wave 2 storage-side complete (Plan 03); sibling Wave 2 plan 04-04 (notificationScheduler.ts lightLevel refactor) in progress (commit 87bc085 in, more pending). Wave 3 (catalog + UX banner + reschedule trigger) blocked on 04-04.

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 9 (Schema Foundation + Migration Core)
Plan: 03 of 7 (Wave 2: Storage envelope + migration wiring) — COMPLETE
Status: In progress (3/7 plans complete in Phase 4; sibling 04-04 in progress)
Last activity: 2026-04-30 — Plan 04-03 complete (Wave 2 useStorage envelope-aware migration; backup-then-write, B2 single-stage 'load' failure analytics, envelope-emitting save path; tsc + check:legacy-fields + smoke:migration 63/63 all green)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 43% (v1.1 milestone, 3/7 phase 4 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed (v1.0): 7
- Average duration: ~9 min
- Total execution time: ~1.0 hours

**By Phase (v1.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-camera-in-chat | 1 | 25 min | 25 min |
| 02-problem-tracking-core | 3 | 17 min | 6 min |
| 03-reminders-tasks-plant-detail-ui | 3 | 24 min | 8 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- v1.0 shipped 2026-03-19 across 7 plans
- v1.1 in progress: Phase 4 Plans 01+02+03 complete (Wave 0 test infra + Wave 1 types/mappers + Wave 2 storage wiring, ~26 min total — Plan 03 included a cross-session resume due to rate limit)

**v1.1 Plan Metrics:**

| Phase / Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|--------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 04 / Plan 01 (Wave 0 test infra) | 5 min | 3 | 5 |
| Phase 04 / Plan 02 (Wave 1 types + mappers) | 4 min | 2 | 8 |
| Phase 04 / Plan 03 (Wave 2 storage envelope) | ~17 min | 2 | 1 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.1 schema is a one-way migration with versioned envelope; legacy `sunHours`/`waterEvery` stay `@deprecated` optional for v1.1 only (SCHEMA-08), grep guard rejects new reads
- Three-zone seasonality (Northern temperate / Southern temperate / Tropical) from day one — never two-hemisphere only (SEASON-01, SEASON-02)
- Cold-season default uses category-factor heuristic during Phase 4 migration; Phase 8 catalog overrides per-`PlantDBEntry` with expert-vetted values (WATER-04 + WATER-07 + CAT-08)
- Soil-check plants get a new `'check_soil'` task type, no health-score penalty for overdue watering, low-frequency check-in notification (CRIT-5)
- Paywall lifts to App-level context (mirrors NotificationContext pattern); deferred callback after purchase, no modal stacking (CRIT-4 + PAY-01..03)
- Diagnosis resume is text-only by design; explicit copy + system-message context summary; message-count limit per diagnosis lifetime, not per session (MOD-4 + MOD-5 + DIAG-04..06)
- [Phase 04-schema-foundation-migration-core]: Wave 0 ALLOWLIST extended from planner's 24 entries to 27 to keep grep guard exit 0 today (3 transitional readers found in baseline scan); v1.2 target remains 0 entries
- [Phase 04-schema-foundation-migration-core]: Migration smoke runner uses single locked compile path (typescript.transpileModule) with no fallback by policy — fallbacks hide real source-level problems
- [Phase 04-schema-foundation-migration-core / Plan 02]: SOIL_CHECK_DB_IDS includes both 'aloe' (legacy/fixture) and 'aloe-vera' (canonical catalog id) — 7 entries vs planner's 6, additive deviation to satisfy two simultaneous contracts
- [Phase 04-schema-foundation-migration-core / Plan 02]: 9 transitional consumer reads of plant.sunHours / plant.waterEvery shimmed with per-line `// @ts-expect-error: legacy field made optional in v1.1; consumer migration in plan 04-04` markers — built-in cleanup signal when 04-04 migrates each read
- [Phase 04-schema-foundation-migration-core / Plan 02]: migration.ts is runtime-pure — bare `require('./plantInfo')` inside try/catch works in both Metro (static analysis) and Node ESM (ReferenceError caught), enabling the smoke runner without conditional-require helpers
- [Phase 04]: [Plan 03]: B2 simplified stage contract honored — single migration_failed emission with stage: 'load' covers any pre-write throw (read/parse/migrate/backup-write/envelope-write). Plan 07 owns separate stage: 'reschedule' emission.
- [Phase 04]: [Plan 03]: On migration throw, best-effort legacy parse runs in catch block so user keeps their plants on screen while migrationFailed flag drives banner. migration_failed event fires AFTER fallback parse so plantCount payload reflects what hydrated, not 0.
- [Phase 04]: [Plan 03]: Three-flag context surface (migrationFailed, migrationJustHappened, acknowledgeMigrationReschedule) enables Plan 06 banner and Plan 07 reschedule trigger to wire independently. Failure during migration sets migrationFailed=true AND didMigrate=false so reschedule effect won't fire on a failed migration.

### Pending Todos

None yet for v1.1.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 4 (Schema):** AsyncStorage write is not atomic from the user's perspective — kill-during-migration on real device is a release blocker (CRIT-1). Backup blob + idempotent re-runs + analytics events are mandated by SCHEMA-02/03/05/07.
- **Phase 4 (Notifications):** All scheduled OS notifications must be cancelled and rebuilt against the new schema as part of migration completion (SCHEMA-06 + CRIT-3); `notificationScheduler` must be refactored to consume `lightLevel` before this can ship without throwing in `calculateSunWindow`.
- **Phase 7 (Edge functions):** `chat-diagnosis`, `diagnose-plant`, `identify-plant` edge function source not yet read — backward-compat window design needs research before Phase 7 plans lock.
- **Phase 9 (Paywall):** Modal-stacking pattern is the highest revenue risk in v1.1; iOS+Android × free × upgraded × cancelled-purchase test matrix is mandatory before ship.
- **No test framework:** Migration regressions caught only by hand-run smoke test until a test runner is added in a future milestone.
